# FEUP_PROG
Repository for the course "Programação" (EIC0012) of the second semester of the first year of MIEIC in FEUP.

In this repository there is my final version of the practical assignment of this course in the lective year of 2015/2016.

During this course the students had to do 1 practical assignment divided into 2 segments.

The first one had the following objectives:
* Development of simple interfaces
* Detection of invalid keyboard inputs
* Output formatting
* Read and Write to text files
* Use of control structures of a program (selection and repetition)
* Use of different data structures such as strings, array/vectors, structs, files.
* Use of functions, with arguments passed through value and reference.
