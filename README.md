# FEUP_PROG
Repository for the course "Programação" (EIC0012) of the second semester of the first year of MIEIC in FEUP.

In this repository there is my final version of the practical assignment of this course in the lective year of 2015/2016.

During this course the students had to do 1 practical assignment divided into 2 segments.

The first one had the following objectives:
* Development of simple interfaces
* Detection of invalid keyboard inputs
* Output formatting
* Read and Write to text files
* Use of control structures of a program (selection and repetition)
* Use of different data structures such as strings, array/vectors, structs, files
* Use of functions, with arguments passed through value and reference

The second one was an update on the first project with the following objectives:
* Use of classes
* Use of overloaded functions and operators
* Use of template functions
* Use of iterators
* Use of sorting algorithms
* Use of many different types of data structures such as maps, multimaps, etc.

The context of this project was to create a supermarket managing software which harbored different shops, and within each shop there were products and clients. The final and most challenging part was to use maps and multimaps in order to compare different products' number of sales, in order to choose the best (or the top 10) product(s) to publicise to a certain costumer.
